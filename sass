There are 2 CSS preprocessors:-
  1) Less https://lesscss.org/
  2) Sass https://sass-lang.com/

Sass has 2 syntaxes available:
  Sass itself (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) in .sass files
  SCSS (Sassy CSS) in .scss files, which is something halfway between regular CSS and Sass
  
Remember that:
  Sass is the name of the preprocessor
  SCSS is easier to learn
  all features are available for both syntaxes
  everything in SCSS is available in Sass  
  --> We’re actually going to write SCSS but still call it Sass.
  We’re gonna use SCSS for a few reasons:
      readibility: the syntax is very similar to CSS
      learning curve: it only adds a few additional features on top of CSS
      compatibility; a CSS file is a valid SCSS file
      resources: lots of online articles to read and open source libraries to use
      expandibility: it’s easy to go from SCSS to Sass
--> sass provides variables, nesting,mixins,extensions, operators.

SASS vs. LESS :-
================
--> sass uses $ to declare variable
--> less uses @ to declare variable
--> Both preprocessors share some of the same properties: Both SASS and LESS allow for the use of mixins and variables.
     One difference, though, is that SASS is based on Ruby,while LESS uses JavaScript.
--> With SASS, users are free to choose between “indented syntax” or SCSS.  LESS doesn’t offer this choice

SASS built-in functions:-
========================
-> to convert a color from hexa to rgb we have rgba() function in sass , if we pass hex code and the opacity we want it will convert into 
    rgb color
      ex:-  
          rgba(#333,0.5)
-> fade-out() this is also same like rgba() function with some opacity           
        fade-out(#000,0.6)  
    the difference is that fade-out function will take the 1-specified transparency value    
    the above fade-out will give the result as 
            rgba(0,0,0,0.4)
--> percentage() function is used to caluclate width in percentages
      width:percentage(50px / 1000px)
--> other functions like
      darken(red,20%)
      lighten(blue,30%)
